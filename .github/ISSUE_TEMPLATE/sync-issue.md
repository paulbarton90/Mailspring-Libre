Thanks for taking the time to file an issue! The Mailspring community uses GitHub issues to coordinate development.

Before filling out this form, try searching for both open and closed issues here: https://github.com/Foundry376/Mailspring/issues. Upvoting an existing sync issue is MUCH better than submitting a new one - it often takes a while for them to be merged and we use issue upvotes to prioritize development.
